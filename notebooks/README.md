1. Open the Anaconda.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook.
3. Navigate to the notebooks directory and open the EDA notebook (nova_eda.ipynb).
4. Install packages like vaderSentiment and spacy using anaconda prompt 
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, visualize it, and extract insights.

## Task 2: Stock Data Analysis
Processing the Data

1. Open the Anaconda.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook.
3. Navigate to the notebooks directory and open the EDA notebook (stock_price_analysis.ipynb).
4. Install yfinance package using anaconda prompt 
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the stock price data, calculate technical indicators, visualize the data, and analyze the stock performance.
